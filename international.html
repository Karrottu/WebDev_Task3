                        <br>
                        <p>Having received the assessment of overseas qualifications document/s indicating that the applicant has the necessary entry requirements for the course, the applicant can submit the application form. Applicants who are abroad and wish to enroll in the courses open in September must send the application form to the Admissions Office by not later than the end of June of the same year. Applications must be supported by the following documentation:</p>
                        <p class="ml-5">1) A complete copy of the application form</p>
                        <p class="ml-5">2) Photocopies of all the Certificates/Qualifications required (or a photocopy of the result slips) together with an official translation into English where applicable</p><br>
                        <p class="ml-5">3) English Language Proficiency Certificate where applicable</p>
                        <p class="ml-5">4) Photocopy of the identity card or passport</p>
                        <p class="ml-5">5) The assessment of overseas qualifications obtained from the Malta Qualification Recognition Information Centre (Malta QRIC)</p>
                        <p class="ml-5">6) A verification document from International Verification Agency IVA-WAEC-UK where applicable.</p>
                        <p>If the student is resident in Malta the original certificates and their photocopies together with the passport must be presented at the time of application. All certificates must be in English or Maltese. Certificates issued in all other languages must be translated into English or Maltese by a recognized authority, authenticated, and bear an official stamp (e.g. Embassy Official Stamp).</p>
                        <p>European Union regulations apply to EU nationals, as specified by law.
                        The languages used in the delivery of all lectures are Maltese and English. Both languages are used simultaneously. Applicants must have the necessary English or Maltese proficiency level required by the course.
                        All applicants must ensure that they have the necessary funds to support themselves. They may be asked to make a declaration of resources or otherwise give an assurance to the Principal Immigration Officer that they have sufficient resources for the period of residence for themselves and their dependents.</p>
                        <p>Applicants may also be subject to the condition that they and their dependants are covered by sickness insurance in respect of all risks in Malta.
                        Accepted applicants must ensure that they follow the immigration rules before entering Malta. Applicants are advised to contact the Immigration Authorities in Malta or the nearest Maltese Diplomatic Mission for further information on this issue. Conditions vary from country to country.</p>
                        <p>All applicants are subject to immigration regulations as specified by the Maltese Law in force.
                        The College can help students to obtain long term visas only after they have been accepted as full time students and they have paid their fees, when these apply. Applicants should check with the nearest Maltese Embassy or Consulate whether they require a visa to enter Malta. Applicants may apply for entry visas to Malta from the Maltese, Austrian, Italian or Spanish representation in their country.</p>
                        <p>The visa that is issued is initially valid for one year. This applies to Visas issued by the Maltese Embassy. Visas issued by Austrian, Italian or Spanish representations have a validity of up to 90 days. Following arrival and registration at the College, the students should apply for a uniform residence permit.
                        Nationals of several countries such as members of the Council of Europe, the USA and most Commonwealth countries do not require a Visa to enter Malta for a stay of less than 3 months. However, if they stay longer than 3 months, they should apply for a uniform residence permit.</p>
                        <p>For further information regarding visa applications and Embassies closest to you, please visit <a href="https://foreignaffairs.gov.mt/en/Pages/Home.aspx" target="_blank"> <strong>www.foreign.gov.mt.</strong></a>
                        Students may be asked to undergo medical tests to start a course.
                        Students who do not attend regularly or who do not show the necessary progress will be reported to Immigration Authorities and will have their visa withdrawn.</p>
                        <p><strong>EU/EEA Nationals:</strong> These are normally considered as non fee paying students. However, at present, citizens of Bulgaria and Romania will be required to provide further information about their status in Malta.</p>
                        <p><strong>Non-EU Nationals:</strong> Non-EU nationals attending courses shall pay the respective annual fees indicated in the following schedule. Fees are quoted in Euro (5500 per year for the Institute of Business Management and Commerce courses, 6500 per year for all other courses). Full fees are payable yearly and the balance needs to be settled within two weeks from acceptance for the course.</p>
